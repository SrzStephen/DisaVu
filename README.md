# DisaVu Disaster Response System

DisaVu is a disaster response solution that helps direct relief resources to where they are needed most using a sophisticated machine learning approach. This repository represents our submission for the [AWS Disaster Response Hackathon Powered By Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab](https://awsdisasterresponse.devpost.com/).


## Inspiration

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, or wildfires, can occur suddenly and have a devastating effect on the affected communities. Due to environmental changes induced by climate change, it is possible that the frequency of disasters may increase. It is thus of vital importance that communities are well prepared and that disaster response teams are optimally equipped with tools that make the allocation of limited resources as efficient and effective as possible.

TODO: Satellite images, machine learning, auto-detection, â€¦

*Essentially, DisaVu is a disaster response solution that helps allocate relief resources to where they are needed most using a sophisticated machine learning approach that is able to detect the extent of damage caused by natural disasters based on satellite images.*
